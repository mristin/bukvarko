Bukvarko
========
Bukvarko helps your kids learn the alphabet in a fun way with synthetic speech.

My son started learning how to read and write so I created this simple game
to make the task easier for him. Different animals are shown as "questions" and 
you need to type in the animal name. You get a star for each correct answer. 
If you are unsure about what you wrote, you can have the computer read it out for you.

To avoid confusing the user, I hard-wired the language to Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian
since this is the language in which my family primarily reads and writes.
