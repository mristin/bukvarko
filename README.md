Bukvarko
========
Bukvarko helps your kids learn the alphabet in a fun way with synthetic speech.

My son started learning how to read and write so I created this simple game
to make the task easier for him. Different animals are shown as "questions" and 
you need to type in the animal name. You get a star for each correct answer. 
If you are unsure about what you wrote, you can have the computer read it out for you.

The game supports the following languages:
Bosnian (bs), German (de), English (en), Greek (el), Spanish (es), French (fr), 
Croatian (hr), Italian (it), Macedonian (mk), Norwegian (nb), Polish (pl), 
Portuguese (pt), Slovenian (sl) and Serbian (sr).
