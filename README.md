Bukvarko
========
Bukvarko helps your kids learn the alphabet in a fun way with synthetic speech.

My son wanted to learn the alphabet so I created this game for him. Different animals 
are shown and you need to type the animal name. You get a star for each
correct answer. If you are unsure about what you wrote, you let the computer read it 
out for you.

The game supports the following languages:
Bosnian (bs), German (de), English (en), Greek (el), Spanish (es), French (fr), 
Swiss German (gsw), Croatian (hr), Italian (it), Macedonian (mk), Norwegian (nb), 
Polish (pl), Portuguese (pt), Russian (ru), Slovenian (sl) and Serbian (sr).

Educational advice
------------------
Don't force your kid to learn alphabet if s/he does not show
proper interest. It will just kill the motivation.

Help your kid with the game. It is inteded as a group activity
for both the parent and the child.

It is intentional that the giraffe makes no sound. The lack of sound
will surprise the child and give you the opportunity to 
explain why giraffes generally do not produce any vocalization we can hear. 
For example, see this short video:
