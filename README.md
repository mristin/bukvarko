Bukvarko
========
Bukvarko helps your kids learn the alphabet in a fun way with synthetic speech.

My son started learning how to read and write so I created this simple game
to make the task easier for him. Different animals are shown as "questions" and 
you need to type in the animal name. You get a star for each correct answer. 
If you are unsure about what you wrote, you can have the computer read it out for you.

The game supports the following languages:
German, English, Spanish, French, Croatian, 
Italian, Polish, Portuguese and Serbian.
