Bukvarko
========
Bukvarko helps your kids learn the alphabet in a fun way with synthetic speech.

My son wanted to learn the alphabet so I created this game for him. Different animals 
are shown and you need to type the animal name. You get a star for each
correct answer. If you are unsure about what you wrote, you let the computer read it 
out for you.

The game supports the following languages:
Bosnian (bs), German (de), English (en), Greek (el), Spanish (es), French (fr), 
Croatian (hr), Italian (it), Macedonian (mk), Norwegian (nb), Polish (pl), 
Portuguese (pt), Slovenian (sl) and Serbian (sr).
